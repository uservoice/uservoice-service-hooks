The Netsuite service hook requires that a RESTlet script be deployed to your Netsuite site. This script processes the payload from the service hook and creates a Case. This folder contains a RESTlet script you can use for this purpose. It also contains a Ruby script you can use to test your RESTlet to make sure all permissions are set correctly. See the comments in each file for more details.
